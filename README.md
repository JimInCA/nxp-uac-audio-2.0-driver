# NXP UAC Audio 2.0 Driver to I2S Speakers

![alt text](images/LPCXpresso43S67_setup.jpg?raw=true "Setup")

This repository contains a UAC Audio 2.0 driver for the NXP LCP43S00 series of processors.  As shown, this driver is working as a USB Speaker.  

This repository started out with the NXP Audio driver that only supported Audio 1.0 standard.  This driver has been updated to support the Audio 2.0 standard.  What this means is that instead of data being transferred in USB fast mode, the data will be transferred in USB high speed mode meaning a greater data bandwidth is possible.  This is just a proto-type in that all features of the Audio 2.0 standard may not be supported.  I've only implemented and have tested what was needed to support the USB device as speakers.

## Required Hardware

As shown in the photo above, I'm using the NXP LPCXpresso43S67 V3 Development board to act as the USB Client.  I'm also using two SparkFun I2S Audio Breakout Boards.  The SparkFun I2S Audio Breakout board uses the MAX98357A digital to analog converter (DAC), which converts I2S (not be confused with I2C) audio to an analog signal to drive the speakers.  The board can be configured to output only the left channel audio, right channel, or both.  In my setup, one board has been configured as the right channel and one board has been configured as the left channel.  I'm also using two thin speakers, one for each audio board, which are available from SparkFun as well.

## Required Software

You will need to download and install the latest version of MCUXpresso IDE from NXP.  I'm currently using V11.2.1 for my testing. 

## Test Setup

The following table lists the wiring required for this setup.   For reference, I'v included the color of the hookup wires that I used to connect the LPCXpresso43S67 to the Audio Breakout board in the photo above.  Please be aware that the two SparkFun I2S Audio Breakout boards are wired in parallel. 

LPCXpresso43S67 | Audio Breakout | Hookup Wire Color
--------------- | -------------- | -----------------
J3-4 | BCLK | Green
J3-5 | GND | Black
J3-7 | SD_ | White
J3-8 | DIN | Blue
J3-12 | 2.2V/5.5V | Red
J1-12 | LRCLK | Yellow

## Compiling and Running the Example Program

Once the IDE is up and running, you will need to import the three directories in the repository.  Then it's just a simple matter of compiling the code and downloading the image to your device.  


## Testing

Once you have the device up and running, it's time to verify that it's actually enumerating as an UAC Audio 2.0 device.  One simple way to make sure that the device is enumerating is through Device Manage.  Here is what it looks like on my system:

![alt text](images/DeviceManager.jpg?raw=true "Device Manager")

I believe that the USB Audio 2.0 value is coming from the enumeration data that we supplied to the host computer, so this could be a little misleading.  I'll show you how to verify the driver in a minute or two.

Next let's verify the enumeration data that we supplied to the host during enumeration.  One simple tool that you can use that comes with Widows 10 is USB Device Viewer.  This is a very nice tool in that it will display the enumeration data for all USB devices attached to you system.  Here is what USB Device Viewer shows for our example board:

There's a couple of minor issues that I'll need to clean up when I get a chance, but on the most part, everything is as we would expect.  There are two main points that I want to point out.  First, as you can see in the Connection Status, our device is using high speed mode with two open pipes.  Here is the ConnectionStatus section:

```
ConnectionStatus:                  
Current Config Value:              0x01  -> Device Bus Speed: High (is not SuperSpeed or higher capable)
Device Address:                    0x1C
Open Pipes:                           2
```

The other part that I would like to point out has to do with the two Endpoint Descriptors that are shown at the end of the file listing.  Both are using Isochronous Mode!  You have to have worked with USB for a while to understand why this is an achievement.  

Now to verify which driver is actually being used by our device.  There may be many different ways to find this, but I only know of one.  And that one is by running the program usbdeview by NirSoft.  This program has a very wide view, so I need to cut it in half to show what I want to show:

![alt text](images/USBDeview_left_half.jpg?raw=true "USBDeview")

![alt text](images/USBDeview_right_half.jpg?raw=true "USBDeview")

It's the last line that I'd like to highlight.  The first image shows our device as USB Audio 2.0, but most importantly, pay attention to the VendorID and ProductID.  These match what we are supplying to the host as also shown in the USB Device Viewer.  

But it's the second image that shows what we are looking for an that is that our device is using the usbaudio2.inf along with usbaudio2 driver, which is the Windows Audio 2.0 driver.

To further verify that this is truly supporting UAC Audio 2.0 will require a Beagle USB protocol analyzer, but I don't have an extra $5K nor the need to purchase one right now.  But having used one in the past, the Beagle 5000 is an excellent tool, if you can afford one.

## Conclusion

So that's about it for now.  If I have some extra time, I may work out the issues with the enumeration.  But I doubt that I'll ever have a need to update the driver to support more than just the speakers.  So at this point, this is more of proto-type for proof of concept that the NXP LPC MCU can support the UAC Audio 2.0 standard.

Until next time, have some fun!
